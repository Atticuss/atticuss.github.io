You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

Back in May, the Democrat House Intelligence Committee posted a dump of [Facebook ads ](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-advertisements.htm) purchased by Russian's between 2015 and 2017. Specifically, the HIC claims these ads were purchased by the infamous Internet Research Agency. So naturally, I pulled down the several GB worth of zipped PDFs and started poking around at random ads. 

Each individual ad was given it's own PDF report with a chunk of metadata related to it, such as the date it ran, the groups it targeted and excluded, and the price paid:
