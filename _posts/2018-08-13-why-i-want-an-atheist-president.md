description: I'm not interested in the first woman president, nor the first gay, Asian, or tattooed president. The mark of a society that reveres, instead of abhors, intellectualism will be the election of an atheistic president.

## Intro

I am an atheist. Actually, it may be more apt to refer to myself as an anti-theist because as far as I can tell, religious belief can only be justified from a place of emotional weakness or intellectual dishonesty. That said, despite my fundamental disagreement, my desire for an atheist president is not rooted in a desire to have religious common ground. Nor do I believe that being an atheist would necessarily make for better leadership.
